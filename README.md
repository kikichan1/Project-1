Nexus of Crisis: 
Examining the opioid epidemic and various demographic factors

The number of opioid-related deaths has been rising continuously since 1999. The number of people who died from a drug overdose in 2021 was over six times the number in 1999. Over 75% of the nearly 107,000 drug overdose deaths in 2022 involved an opioid.

Against this background, this project examines the opioid epidemic and explores if there is any correlation between opioid-related deaths and various demographic factors, namely unemployment rate, educational attainment, income level and family size.
